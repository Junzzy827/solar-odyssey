      ['Dish', 'A bowl about 50 km wide at the north pole, with a receiver hung from three towers'],
      ['Where', 'On Mars’s orbit, 60° behind Mars (a Mars trojan point)'],
    ],
    fiction: true,
    notes: [
      'A man-made moon: a hollowed rocky ball covered in hull plates. Bands wrap it along lines of latitude, with small radio dishes and ship entrances here and there.',
      'The big dish at the north pole gathers faint radio waves from distant galaxies and black holes. It is not a weapon.',
      'As you come close, your ship shrinks so the moon is shown at its real size compared with the ship.',
    ],
    real: [
      'The largest real radio dish is China’s FAST, 500 m across, finished in 2016 in a natural hollow among the hills.',
      'The Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico (305 m) hung its receiver from three towers. Its cables broke and it collapsed in 2020.',
      'The far side of the Moon is shielded from Earth’s radio noise, so it is a very quiet place. NASA has studied building a radio telescope inside a crater there (LCRT).',
      'The biggest thing people have built in space is the International Space Station, about 109 m wide.',
    ],
    quiz: {
      question: 'Why is the far side of the Moon interesting for radio telescopes?',
      choices: ['Earth’s radio noise cannot reach it', 'It is warm there', 'It is closest to the Sun'],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: 'Earth is never in the sky on the far side, so the Moon itself blocks TV, phone and other radio noise from Earth. Even very faint radio waves from space can be heard.',
    },
  },
  [CARRIER_ID]: {
    rows: [
      ['Size', 'About 1.6 km long (about 2.5 times your ship)'],

    real: [
      'Today, cargo in space is carried by supply ships to the International Space Station, such as SpaceX’s Dragon, Japan’s HTV-X and Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus.',
      'Some asteroids hold lots of metals such as iron, nickel and platinum, or water ice. Materials and fuel (hydrogen and oxygen from water) for use in space might not need to be launched from Earth.',
      'NASA’s Psyche spacecraft left in 2023 to study Psyche, an asteroid thought to be made largely of metal.',
    ],
    quiz: {
      question: 'Why could water ice on asteroids be useful?',
      choices: ['It can be made into rocket fuel (hydrogen and oxygen)', 'For swimming in space', 'To cool the Sun'],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: 'Splitting water with electricity gives hydrogen and oxygen. Both are rocket fuel, and they also give drinking water and air.',

    real: [
      'Moon dust (regolith) contains oxygen, silicon, iron and aluminium, which can be made into glass and metal.',
      'The Moon has weak gravity and no air, so one idea is a “mass driver” that speeds cargo along a rail and flings it into space (part of O’Neill’s colony plans).',
    ],
    quiz: {
      question: 'Why is it easier to send materials into space from the Moon than from Earth?',
      choices: ['The Moon’s gravity is about one sixth of Earth’s', 'The Moon is closer to the Sun', 'The Moon has oceans'],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: 'The weaker the gravity, the less speed and energy a launch needs. And with no air, there is no air resistance either.',

      'The Moon always shows the same face to Earth, because it turns exactly once for every trip around Earth (tidal locking). So its far side is never seen from Earth.',

      'Japan’s lunar orbiter Kaguya (2007) was named after the princess. In 2024 Japan’s SLIM made a “pinpoint landing” within about 100 m of its target.',
      'The far side is not the “dark side”. At new moon, the far side is in full sunlight.',

    quiz: {
      question: 'Why can’t we see the far side of the Moon from Earth?',
      choices: ['It turns exactly once for each trip around Earth', 'The far side is always at night', 'The Moon does not spin'],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: 'Its orbit and its spin take the same time (about 27 days), so the same face always points at Earth. This is called tidal locking.',

      ['Where', 'Sun–Earth L5 point (on Earth’s orbit, 60° behind Earth)'],
    ],
    fiction: true,
    notes: [
      'Two bowls joined back to back at a narrow waist. The waist is close to the spin axis, where you feel almost no weight, so it is the spaceport where ships come and go.',
      'Inside the bowls, bands of fields, seas and towns alternate with clear window bands that let in sunlight. The farther out you go, the faster the ground moves and the heavier you feel.',
      'The thin column through the middle carries an elevator between the two bowls and holds the mirrors that send light into the window bands.',

      'Spin gravity equals (spin rate)² × radius. With a radius of 8 km, turning once about every 3 minutes gives Earth’s gravity (9.8 m/s²).',
      'At the Sun–Earth L4 and L5 points, the pulls of the Sun and Earth balance so that objects tend to stay there. Two Earth “Trojan asteroids” have been found: 2010 TK7 (found 2011) and 2020 XL5 (found 2021).',
      'NASA’s twin STEREO spacecraft passed near Earth’s L4 and L5 regions around 2009, watching the Sun from the side.',
    ],
    quiz: {
      question: 'Inside a spinning colony, what gives you weight when you stand on the ground?',
      choices: ['The outward push from the spin', 'The weight of the air inside', 'Earth’s gravity'],
      answer: 0,
      explanation: 'As the colony spins, everything inside is pressed outward. That push works like gravity on the outer ground. The bigger the radius, the slower it can spin for the same weight.',

  question: 'Of the five Earth–Moon Lagrange points, which ones can hold an object in place stably?',
  choices: ['L1 and L2', 'L4 and L5', 'All five'],
  answer: 1,
  explanation: 'At L4 and L5, something that drifts a little keeps circling back around the point. At L1, L2 and L3 it drifts away, so spacecraft there keep correcting their position with thrusters.',

const unstableQuizEn: Quiz = {
  question: 'Why do real spacecraft at L1, L2 and L3 fire their thrusters now and then?',
  choices: ['A small drift grows, so they correct their position', 'Air drag slows them down', 'They get cold far from the Sun'],
  answer: 0,
  explanation: 'L1, L2 and L3 are like a ball balanced on top of a hill: a small drift grows. Small burns keep the spacecraft in place (station-keeping).',

  choices: ['Around Earth–Moon L2', 'In geostationary orbit', 'Around Mars'],
  answer: 0,
